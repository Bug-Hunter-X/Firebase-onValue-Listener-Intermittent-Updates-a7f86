In a Firebase project, I encountered an unusual issue where data wasn't updating correctly in real-time despite using the `onValue` listener.  The data would sometimes update, but other times it would remain stale, even though changes were being made on the database. The problem was intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently. The `onValue` listener was attached correctly to the database reference, and the data structure was as expected.  The application was written in Javascript using the Firebase Admin SDK. No errors were reported by the console.
